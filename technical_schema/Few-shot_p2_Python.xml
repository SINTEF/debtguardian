        Technical Debt 1. Long Method
        Explanation: It refers to method in software that is overly long. A method that contains too
        many lines of code, violates principles like Single Responsibility and leading to code that's hard to
        understand, maintain, and test. Such methods often encapsulate multiple functionalities, making them prone to
        bugs and difficult to modify. Simplifying these methods or breaking down into smaller, more cohesive units can
        enhance code readability and maintainability.

        Bad Example 1.1: Long Method
        <![CDATA[
class UserManager:
    def process_user(self, user_id):
        # Validate user ID
        if user_id <= 0:
            print("Invalid user ID provided.")
            return

        # Load user data
        user_data = self.load_user_data(user_id)
        if user_data is None:
            print(f"No user found with ID: {user_id}")
            return

        # Process user orders
        orders = self.get_user_orders(user_id)
        if not orders:
            print("User has no orders.")
            return

        for order in orders:
            if order.is_delivered():
                print(f"Order {order.id} already delivered.")
            else:
                self.process_order(order)
                print(f"Processed order: {order.id}")

        # Update user activity log
        self.update_user_activity_log(user_id, "Processed orders.")

    def load_user_data(self, user_id):
        # Assume this method returns user data as a string or None if not found
        return "UserData"

    def get_user_orders(self, user_id):
        # Assume this method returns a list of user orders
        return []

    def process_order(self, order):
        # Assume this processes the order
        pass

    def update_user_activity_log(self, user_id, activity):
        # Log user activity
        pass

]]>
        - Issue: The method handles multiple tasks such as user validation, loading user data, and processing user
        orders all in one. This makes it long and complex which makes it hard to maintain.

        Good Example 1.2: Short method
        <![CDATA[
class UserManager:
    def process_user(self, user_id):
        if not self.validate_user_id(user_id):

        if user_data is None:
            print(f"No user found with ID: {user_id}")
            return

        self.process_user_orders(user_id)
        self.update_user_activity_log(user_id, "Processed orders.")

    def validate_user_id(self, user_id):
        if user_id <= 0:
            print("Invalid user ID provided.")
            return False
        return True

    def load_user_data(self, user_id):
        # Assume this method returns user data or None if not found
        return "UserData"

    def process_user_orders(self, user_id):
        orders = self.get_user_orders(user_id)
        if not orders:
            print("User has no orders.")
            return

        for order in orders:
            self.process_order(order)

    def get_user_orders(self, user_id):
        # Assume this method returns a list of user orders
        return []

    def process_order(self, order):
        if order.is_delivered():
            print(f"Order {order.id} already delivered.")
        else:
            print(f"Processed order: {order.id}")
            # Assume this processes the order

    def update_user_activity_log(self, user_id, activity):
        # Log user activity
        pass

        - Benefit: The long method is broken down into smaller methods, each handling a specific part of the process.
        This improves readability and makes the code easier to maintain.

]]>
        - Issue: The method handles setting up a new customer account, including data validation, account creation, and
        sending a welcome email and more, all in one overly complex method.

        Technical Debt 2. Duplicated code blocks
        Explanation: It refers to instances where the same or very similar code blocks appear in multiple locations
        within a software project. It can lead to maintenance challenges, as any change to the logic would need to be
        replicated across all instances to maintain consistency. It also increases the codebase size unnecessarily and
        can lead to bugs if the copies diverge over time. Refactoring to remove duplicated code, often by creating
        shared functions or classes, can reduce this debt, improving maintainability and reducing the potential for
        errors.

        Bad Example 2.1: Duplicated code blocks
        <![CDATA[
class TransactionProcessor:
    def process_deposit(self, amount, account):
        if amount <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Amount must be positive")
        fee = self.calculate_fee(amount, "deposit")
        account.deposit(amount - fee)
        return fee

    def process_withdrawal(self, amount, account):
        if amount <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Amount must be positive")
        if account.get_balance() < amount:
            raise ValueError("Insufficient funds")
        fee = self.calculate_fee(amount, "withdrawal")
        account.withdraw(amount + fee)
        return fee

    def calculate_fee(self, amount, type):
        fee_rate = 0.005 if type == "deposit" else 0.01
        return amount * fee_rate

]]>
        - Issue: Duplicated code is spread across multiple methods for processing different types of transactions in a
        financial application. Each method checks various conditions and applies transaction fees differently based on
        the transaction type.

        Good Example 2.2: No Duplicated code blocks
        <![CDATA[
class TransactionProcessor:
    def process_transaction(self, amount, account, type):
        self.validate_amount(amount)
        fee = self.calculate_fee(amount, type)
        if type == "deposit":
            account.deposit(amount - fee)
        elif type == "withdrawal":
            self.validate_funds(amount, account)
            account.withdraw(amount + fee)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported transaction type")

    def validate_amount(self, amount):
        if amount <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Amount must be positive")

    def validate_funds(self, amount, account):
        if account.get_balance() < amount:
            raise ValueError("Insufficient funds")

    def calculate_fee(self, amount, type):
        fee_rate = 0.005 if type == "deposit" else 0.01
        return amount * fee_rate

]]>
        - Benefit: This code avoids technical debt related to duplicated code blocks by eliminating duplicated condition
        checking and fee calculation by centralizing the transaction processing logic.


        Bad Example 2.3: Duplicated code blocks
        <![CDATA[
class ReportGenerator:
    def generate_sales_report(self, date):
        query = f"SELECT * FROM sales WHERE date = '{date}'"

    def convert_to_data_point(self, record):
        return {'date': record['date'], 'value': record['value']}

]]>
        - Issue: Duplicated code blocks of database query and data processing logic across methods that retrieve
        different datasets from a database for reporting purposes.

        Good Example 2.4: No Duplicated code blocks
        <![CDATA[
class ReportGenerator:
    def generate_report(self, type, date):

        Technical Debt 3. Preserve original exceptions
        Explanation: Effective exception handling is crucial for maintaining robust and maintainable software.
        Inadequate handling of exceptions, where original error messages are not logged or preserved, can significantly
        obscure the underlying cause of an exception. This lack of clarity complicates debugging and error resolution,
        potentially leading to prolonged system downtime and increased maintenance complexity. Neglecting to preserve
        and log the full details of original exceptions can exacerbate technical debt, as developers spend more time
        identifying and fixing issues without clear error information.

        Bad Example 3.1: Not preserving original exceptions
        <![CDATA[
class FileProcessor:
    def process_file(self, path):
        try:
            content = self.read_file(path)
            # Further processing
        except IOError as e:
            raise Exception("Failed to process the file.")  # Not Preserving exception

    def read_file(self, path):
        # Read file logic
        with open(path, 'r') as file:
            return file.read()

]]>
        - Issue: When an error occurs during the processing of a file, the original exception is discarded, and a new,
        less informative exception is thrown.

        Good Example 3.2: Preserving original exceptions
        <![CDATA[
class FileProcessor:
    def process_file(self, path):
        try:
            content = self.read_file(path)
            # Further processing
        except IOError as e:
            raise Exception("Failed to process the file.") from e

    def read_file(self, path):
        # Read file logic
        with open(path, 'r') as file:
            return file.read()

]]>
        - Benefit: In this refactored version, the original IOException is preserved by including it as the cause in the
        newly thrown exception. This maintains the stack trace and the root cause details.

        Bad Example 3.3: Not preserving original exceptions
        <![CDATA[
import sqlite3

class DataImporter:
    def import_data(self):
        try:
            # Data import logic, assuming it involves a database operation
            self.connect_database_and_execute()
        except sqlite3.DatabaseError as e:
            logging.error("Database error: %s", str(e))
            raise ValueError("Import failed due to database error")  # Losing original exception context

    def connect_database_and_execute(self):
        # Simulate database connection and operation
        raise sqlite3.DatabaseError("Unable to connect to database")

]]>
        - Issue: the original exception is logged, but then a new exception is thrown without linking the original
        cause, leading to potential loss of valuable debugging information.

        Good Example 3.4: Preserving original exceptions
        <![CDATA[
import sqlite3

class DataImporter:
    def import_data(self):
        try:
            # Data import logic, assuming it involves a database operation
            self.connect_database_and_execute()
        except sqlite3.DatabaseError as e:
            logging.error("Database error: %s", str(e))
            raise ValueError("Import failed due to database error") from e

    def connect_database_and_execute(self):
        # Simulate database connection and operation
        raise sqlite3.DatabaseError("Unable to connect to database")
]]>
        - Benefit: This improved version includes the original DatabaseError in the new exception, thus preserving the
        entire exception chain which aids in troubleshooting and understanding the full context of the error.

        ######################################################
        Technical Debt 4. Statements on separate lines
        Explanation: It emphasizes the importance of code readability and organization. This principal advocates for
        proper indentation, limiting the length of each line in the code and avoiding multiple declarations or
        statements on a single line. Adhering to this practice enhances readability, makes the code easier to understand
        and maintain, and reduces the likelihood of errors. It is a key aspect of writing clean, well-structured code,
        and ignoring it can contribute to technical debt by making the codebase more cumbersome and error-prone.

        Bad Example 4.1: Statements on a Single Line
        <![CDATA[
class AccountManager:
    def update_account_balance(self, account, amount):
        if account and account.is_active(): account.set_balance(account.get_balance() + amount); account.set_last_update_timestamp(time.time())

]]>
        - Issue: Multiple operations are unnecessarily condensed onto single lines, which can make debugging and
        understanding the code flow more difficult.


        Good Example 4.2: Statements on Separate Lines
        <![CDATA[
class AccountManager:
    def update_account_balance(self, account, amount):
        if account and account.is_active():
            account.set_balance(account.get_balance() + amount)
            account.set_last_update_timestamp(time.time())

]]>
        - Benefit:Refactoring the code to place statements on separate lines improves readability and makes it easier to
        set breakpoints during debugging.


        Bad Example 4.3: Statements on a Single Line
        <![CDATA[
class OrderProcessor:
    def process_order(self, order):
        if order and order.is_valid() and not order.is_processed(): order.set_processed(True); print("Order processed")

        - Issue: Logic that performs a series of checks and operations is all placed on a single line, complicating the
        readability and maintenance of the code.

        Good Example 4.4: Statements on Separate Lines
        <![CDATA[
class OrderProcessor:
    def process_order(self, order):
        if order and order.is_valid() and not order.is_processed():
            order.set_processed(True)
            print("Order processed")

        - Benefit: Expanding the logic into a more structured format with each statement on its own line makes the code
        cleaner and more understandable.
